# odin-recipes

firs odin project

making a simple html project with all the knowledge i've learned thus far.

the theme for this project is making basic recipe website.

notes:
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
